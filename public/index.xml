      <description>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) created the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to direct computing professionals to act and promote ethical behavior in the profession (ACM, 2018). The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is in four sections: General Ethical Principles, Professional Responsibilities, Professional Leadership Principles, and Compliance With the Code (ACM, 2018). This paper will discuss the seven General Ethical Principles and classify them into the three major areas of ethics, privacy, and social justice.</description>

      <description>In the book Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine, Turner describes experimental design from a clinical perspective “as an experiment with a series of observations made under conditions in which the influences of interest are controlled by the research scientist”, Turner, 2013. The randomized trial is the classic example of experimental design. The data is randomized to one of two or more experimental groups. Then the significant differences between the sets are analyzed.</description>

      <description>I am a junior level data scientist professional with a Master’s Degree in Data Science. I have demonstrated abilities to extract insights from data and use them to make recommendations based on statistical modeling. I enjoy defining and solving problems by distilling abstract/complex theories and datasets into simple terms and draft meaningful easy-to-understand outcomes for both technical and non-technical audiences.
In addition to my Data Science profession, I have a background in civil engineering.</description>
