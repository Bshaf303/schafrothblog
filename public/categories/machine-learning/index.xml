      <description>K-Means ClusteringThe first section uses the iris data set and k-means clustering starting with 3 cluster centers and an nstart of 15. The results are displayed below in the fit object. There are 3 clusters sized 50, 62, and 38. The within sum of squares by cluster is 88.4% and the smaller number (15.15, 39.82, &amp;amp; 23.87) indicates how closely related objects are in the clusters. The first cluster has the most related objects and the second cluster has the lesser of related objects mostly taken from the third cluster.</description>

      <title>Application of K-Means - A Brief Case Study</title>

      <description>K-Means Case StudyThis article is an example of practical use for k-means clustering from a case study conducted in a Chinese city. The project comes from the IoT smart city concept and looks at real-time traffic network data and uses the k-means algorithm to analyze real data. The emerging intelligent transportation techniques are helping the urban environment run smoother though very complex. The authors take a small segment and look at supply chain logistics such as for manufacturing (raw materials), utilities (coal), banking (banknotes), and the cost related to the processing and transportation between the center and the supplier points.</description>

      <description>Reinforcement Learning - Grid World ProblemThe first section looks at the grid world concept/problem. The environment is a 3x4 grid and the goal is to move from the start xy (1,1) (called a “state”&#34;) location to the opposite corner (4,3) called the goal state. The actions are up, down, left, right. We have the rewards of +1 &amp;amp; -1. We want the agent to find the shortest sequence of actions to get from start to end (goal).</description>

      <description>K-Means AnalysisThis project will use the Wholesale customer Data Set from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers. The data has 440 orbs and 8 variables. The data has the Channel and Region as integers but they are categorical in nature with 2 channels and 3 regions. We think this may need to be taken out of the analysis but will leave them in for now. A general observation about the variables there are outliers in the 6 major variables: fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, delicassen.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe data set is the mushroom set retrieved from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom. It consists of 8124 orbs and 23 variables. The classification variable is the “type” either edible (e) or poisonous (p). The remaining 22 variables are the predictors and consist of multiple levels from 1 to 12 each. The data columns will need to be named and are coded in short for each. There are 2480 NA’s found and in one variable “sr” or stalk root.</description>

      <description>Decision Tree and Random ForestThis analysis will utilize the data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv and the purpose is to find the differences between the decision tree method and the random forest method for predicting wine quality from the 11 variables that indicate each wine’s chemical readings. The 12th variable is the quality rating given to these 1599 wines and is used as the predictor in the models. The quality has ratings from 3 to 8.</description>

      <description>Naive Bayes SMS Message ClassifierThis analysis demonstrates the naive bayes classifier in determining the spam or ham status of 4837 SMS messages. The data set is retrieved from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection. The data needs explicit cleaning to prepare it to run through a naive bayes classifier. A training and test set is created to train and validate the predictive ability ofy the model. There are summary plots of the words found in abundance in the data.</description>

      <title>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) - Heart Disease Dataset</title>

      <description>Introduction to K-Nearest NeighborKNN is a supervised learning algorithm and uses a training sample from the dataset, which classifies groups into different classes. It is a classifier used to predict the level of an unknown point (observation) and does this by measuring the points nearest to the unknown point. It works well in measuring the differences between multiple classes that are complex and hard to detect. KNN is considered a simple classification and regression algorithm.</description>
