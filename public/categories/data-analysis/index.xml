      <description>Case StudyCan a mobile phone application identify a species of a plant by photo analysis?
This analysis is hypothetical and analyzes the feasibility of developing a mobile application for mobile phones (that photograph and store pictures) and identify flower pictures stored in memory. This exercise is a small part of a project and will only focus on the exploratory elements of a sample dataset called iris.
For a successful application, the algorithm shall correctly identify a flower species from a photo on the user’s phone using an image recognition model.</description>

      <description>R Graph Plotting SystemThis brief analysis demonstrates the quick ways to look at data by plotting the data points using R and ggplot2. There are four small datasets used in displaying the individual data characteristics. The point is fast and simplistic plot to reveal the represented data.

      <description>K-Means ClusteringThe first section uses the iris data set and k-means clustering starting with 3 cluster centers and an nstart of 15. The results are displayed below in the fit object. There are 3 clusters sized 50, 62, and 38. The within sum of squares by cluster is 88.4% and the smaller number (15.15, 39.82, &amp;amp; 23.87) indicates how closely related objects are in the clusters. The first cluster has the most related objects and the second cluster has the lesser of related objects mostly taken from the third cluster.</description>

      <description>Hierarchical ClusteringThe hierarchical agglomerative clustering starts with each observation as a cluster and pairs two at a time until all clusters are merged into one single cluster. The number of clusters is not known or specified in advance. The distance between all pairs of points in the data is recorded. There is a dendrogram (upside down tree structure) that is the output of the grouping of clusters. It represents and shows how many clusters were found in the data.</description>

      <description>R Graphics for Exploring DataThe graphics device prints the graphics to screen or into a file type read by other apps. The screen device is on our computers. For windows its windows(), mac its quartz() and Linux its x11(). I am assuming this is built into the R functions plot(), xyplot(), and qplot() when we use them to plot. The other “devices” are the file types that are created by the device.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis - Exploratory Graphics</title>

      <guid>/post/2018/07/22/data-analysis-exploratory-graphics/</guid>
      <description>Exploratory Graphics in RThe focus of this analysis is on the ways to graph data set variables. The first section uses the EPA data set retrieved from: https://github.com/jtleek/modules/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/exploratoryGraphs/data/avgpm25.csv the data was imported into a csv file and then used for this first section. Code notes for explaination.
The first part uses the RStudio base functionality to plot graphics then we use maps, lattice, and ggplot2 to compare and contrast.</description>

      <title>Data Exploration - The Chicago Dataset</title>

      <description>IntroductionThis article is about using the tidyverse package in R to explore data. The Chicago dataset is the basis for this analysis. The data is air quality measurements taken over 19 years. The focus is on using the dplyr package to do the analysis. The dplyr package is part of the tidyverse in R and a suite of tools to analyze, transform, plot, and manipulate data. The base version of R does all of this; however, dplyr will work faster and cost fewer computing resources when used on big data.</description>

      <description>This article will briefly describe the dplyr package in R and the simple functions to analyze data with R for data analytics. The dplyr package in R is used for data manipulation and transformation because, typically, the data is not in a usable form. The package is useful for exploratory data analysis and a method of statistical analysis using graphical techniques. Some of the benefits are:
get insights from the data intuitivelyfind hidden trendsfind outliers and anomalous datatest assumptionshelp develop models that the data will fitThe dplyr package is used by many data scientists and analysts to manipulate data.</description>

      <description>Exploring the data with base R functionsThe purpose of this post is to show the basic fucntions in R to start a data analysis project. I look at the iris dataset that comes with Rstudio shown below.This briefly covers head(), str(), attributes(), summary(), dim(), names(), indexing [], table(), and plot() functions that come with base R. Simple to use.
Load the iris datasetdata(&amp;quot;iris&amp;quot;) head()Look at the iris dataset with the head() function and lists the first five rows.</description>

      <description>Naive Bayes SMS Message ClassifierThis analysis demonstrates the naive bayes classifier in determining the spam or ham status of 4837 SMS messages. The data set is retrieved from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection. The data needs explicit cleaning to prepare it to run through a naive bayes classifier. A training and test set is created to train and validate the predictive ability ofy the model. There are summary plots of the words found in abundance in the data.</description>

      <title>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) - Heart Disease Dataset</title>

      <description>Introduction to K-Nearest NeighborKNN is a supervised learning algorithm and uses a training sample from the dataset, which classifies groups into different classes. It is a classifier used to predict the level of an unknown point (observation) and does this by measuring the points nearest to the unknown point. It works well in measuring the differences between multiple classes that are complex and hard to detect. KNN is considered a simple classification and regression algorithm.</description>

      <description>Data PreprocessingThe following analysis is of the diamonds dataset downloaded from the tidyverse/ggplot2 Github repository. The data is in a .csv file. The purpose of the analysis is to explore the data and perform data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing needed for modeling. Data cleaning and preprocessing involves checking for missing records, removing missing data, imputing missing data, converting categorical variables with one-hot encoding or dummy variables, scaling data, normalizing data.</description>
