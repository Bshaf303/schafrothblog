      <description>IntroductionThis exploratory data analysis will use the “hourly_44201_2014” data set obtained from the web site: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Raw The data is “Criteria Gases” and labeled “Ozone (44201)” for this particular data set. The data is loaded into RStudio and shows 9,060,694 rows and 24 variables.
There are 24 variables in this data set. Looking through the variables, we can see the first four are coded presumably by the EPA. The Latitude, Longitude, and Datum are geo-location data.</description>

      <title>Data Exploration - The Chicago Dataset</title>

      <description>IntroductionThis article is about using the tidyverse package in R to explore data. The Chicago dataset is the basis for this analysis. The data is air quality measurements taken over 19 years. The focus is on using the dplyr package to do the analysis. The dplyr package is part of the tidyverse in R and a suite of tools to analyze, transform, plot, and manipulate data. The base version of R does all of this; however, dplyr will work faster and cost fewer computing resources when used on big data.</description>

      <description>Exploring the data with base R functionsThe purpose of this post is to show the basic fucntions in R to start a data analysis project. I look at the iris dataset that comes with Rstudio shown below.This briefly covers head(), str(), attributes(), summary(), dim(), names(), indexing [], table(), and plot() functions that come with base R. Simple to use.
Load the iris datasetdata(&amp;quot;iris&amp;quot;) head()Look at the iris dataset with the head() function and lists the first five rows.</description>

      <description>Reinforcement Learning - Grid World ProblemThe first section looks at the grid world concept/problem. The environment is a 3x4 grid and the goal is to move from the start xy (1,1) (called a “state”&#34;) location to the opposite corner (4,3) called the goal state. The actions are up, down, left, right. We have the rewards of +1 &amp;amp; -1. We want the agent to find the shortest sequence of actions to get from start to end (goal).</description>

      <description>K-MeansThis project will use the Wholesale customer Data Set from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers. The data has 440 orbs and 8 variables. The data has the Channel and Region as integers but they are categorical in nature with 2 channels and 3 regions. We think this may need to be taken out of the analysis but will leave them in for now. A general observation about the variables there are outliers in the 6 major variables: fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, delicassen.</description>

      <title>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) - Heart Disease Dataset</title>

      <description>Introduction to K-Nearest NeighborKNN is a supervised learning algorithm and uses a training sample from the dataset, which classifies groups into different classes. It is a classifier used to predict the level of an unknown point (observation) and does this by measuring the points nearest to the unknown point. It works well in measuring the differences between multiple classes that are complex and hard to detect. KNN is considered a simple classification and regression algorithm.</description>
