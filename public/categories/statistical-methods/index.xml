      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo; concerning an analysis of population data concerning machine learning and predictive analytic algorithms can result in bias, and that would be a bit more in-depth for this discussion. According to Bruce and Bruce (2017), the bias seen in statistical measurement or sampling errors is likely due to the process of measurement and sampling methods. Bias may be observable or invisible and detected by referencing or benchmarking values.</description>

      <description>In the book Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine, Turner describes experimental design from a clinical perspective “as an experiment with a series of observations made under conditions in which the research scientist controls the influences of interest”, Turner, 2013. The randomized trial is a classic example of experimental design. The data is randomized to one of two or more experimental groups. Then the significant differences between the sets are analyzed. (Turner, 2013) The Completely Randomized Design, Randomized Block Design, and Factorial design are three experimental designs, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) will tell us whether or not there is a difference between the means of one or more independent categorical groups.</description>
