      <description>&lt;p&gt;    The term &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo; concerning an analysis of population data concerning machine learning and predictive analytic algorithms can result in bias, and that would be a bit more in-depth for this discussion. According to Bruce and Bruce (2017), the bias seen in statistical measurement or sampling errors is likely due to the process of measurement and sampling methods. Bias may be observable or invisible and detected by referencing or benchmarking values. The authors say the algorithm has been misspecified or a critical variable(s) left out (p. 47). Delgado-Rodriquez &amp;amp; Llorca (2004) surmise bias as the &amp;ldquo;lack of internal validity&amp;rdquo; or an improper analysis of the relationship between one thing and the outcome in a data population in which the estimated or proposed statistic that does not equal the actual value. The Delgado-Rodriquez &amp;amp; Llorca also mention categorization of the biases by the stage of research the bias occurs. &amp;ldquo;The most important biases are those produced in the definition and selection of the study population&amp;rdquo; (p.635). The important take away is distinguishing biases from random error or lack of precision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimental Design</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;    In the book Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine, Turner describes experimental design from a clinical perspective “as an experiment with a series of observations made under conditions in which the research scientist controls the influences of interest”, Turner, 2013. The randomized trial is a classic example of experimental design. The data is randomized to one of two or more experimental groups. Then the significant differences between the sets are analyzed. (Turner, 2013) The Completely Randomized Design, Randomized Block Design, and Factorial design are three experimental designs, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) will tell us whether or not there is a difference between the means of one or more independent categorical groups. The ANOVA is an easily calculated method we can use in R.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
