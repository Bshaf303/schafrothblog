      <description>Reinforcement Learning - Grid World ProblemThe first section looks at the grid world concept/problem. The environment is a 3x4 grid and the goal is to move from the start xy (1,1) (called a “state”&#34;) location to the opposite corner (4,3) called the goal state. The actions are up, down, left, right. We have the rewards of +1 &amp;amp; -1. We want the agent to find the shortest sequence of actions to get from start to end (goal).</description>

      <description>Introduction to K-Nearest NeighborKNN is a supervised learning algorithm and uses a training sample from the dataset, which classifies groups into different classes. It is a classifier used to predict the level of an unknown point (observation) and does this by measuring the points nearest to the unknown point. It works well in measuring the differences between multiple classes that are complex and hard to detect. KNN is considered a simple classification and regression algorithm.</description>

      <description>Real-Time Data and Smart Cities  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept suggesting the number of devices connected to the Internet will continue to grow. The Internet has computers and mobile devices connected to it. The expectation is IoT will become more significant with the increasing use of sensors, actuators, and embedded devices. Currently, the Internet connects devices through wired and wireless technologies. Devices also can communicate over a network and then transfer the data to the Internet.</description>
