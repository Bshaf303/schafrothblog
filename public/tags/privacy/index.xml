      <description>&lt;p&gt;    The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has a code of ethics and professional conduct guidelines (ACM, 2018). The &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; is for people that work in computing and a guide to consider when decision making. Section 2.9 outlines the need to design systems that are very secure and recognizing that breaches of computer systems can be malevolent to many people and organizations (ACM, 2018). The ACM states not to roll out systems without thorough testing of security exploits (2018).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
