      <title>Hierarchical Clustering (HCA)</title>

      <description>Hierarchical ClusteringThe hierarchical agglomerative clustering starts with each observation as a cluster and pairs two at a time until all clusters are merged into one single cluster. The number of clusters is not known or specified in advance. The distance between all pairs of points in the data is recorded. There is a dendrogram (upside down tree structure) that is the output of the grouping of clusters. It represents and shows how many clusters were found in the data.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis - Exploratory Graphics</title>

      <description>Exploratory Graphics in RThe focus of this analysis is on the ways to graph data set variables. The first section uses the EPA data set retrieved from: https://github.com/jtleek/modules/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/exploratoryGraphs/data/avgpm25.csv the data was imported into a csv file and then used for this first section. Code notes for explaination.
The first part uses the RStudio base functionality to plot graphics then we use maps, lattice, and ggplot2 to compare and contrast.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis exploratory data analysis will use the “hourly_44201_2014” data set obtained from the web site: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Raw The data is “Criteria Gases” and labeled “Ozone (44201)” for this particular data set. The data is loaded into RStudio and shows 9,060,694 rows and 24 variables.
There are 24 variables in this data set. Looking through the variables, we can see the first four are coded presumably by the EPA. The Latitude, Longitude, and Datum are geo-location data.</description>

      <title>Data Exploration - The Chicago Dataset</title>
      <link>/post/2018/07/07/data-exploration-the-chicago-dataset/</link>

      <guid>/post/2018/07/07/data-exploration-the-chicago-dataset/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionThis article is about using the tidyverse package in R to explore data. The Chicago dataset is the basis for this analysis. The data is air quality measurements taken over 19 years. The focus is on using the dplyr package to do the analysis. The dplyr package is part of the tidyverse in R and a suite of tools to analyze, transform, plot, and manipulate data. The base version of R does all of this; however, dplyr will work faster and cost fewer computing resources when used on big data.</description>

      <title>Data Preprocessing - Diamonds Dataset</title>

      <description>Data PreprocessingThe following analysis is of the diamonds dataset downloaded from the tidyverse/ggplot2 Github repository. The data is in a .csv file. The purpose of the analysis is to explore the data and perform data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing needed for modeling. Data cleaning and preprocessing involves checking for missing records, removing missing data, imputing missing data, converting categorical variables with one-hot encoding or dummy variables, scaling data, normalizing data.</description>
