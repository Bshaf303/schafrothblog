      <description>IntroductionThis article will present a machine learning problem and the concept behind solving the problem. The project will go into detail about the early exploratory steps and build a machine learning model that can be used in production to categorize data. This project is to categorize seven Rocky Mountain tree types found in the forests. In this project, we will use old legacy data from the 1990s and use modern machine learning methods to categorize the data.</description>

      <description>Introduction to K-Nearest NeighborKNN is a supervised learning algorithm and uses a training sample from the dataset, which classifies groups into different classes. It is a classifier used to predict the level of an unknown point (observation) and does this by measuring the points nearest to the unknown point. It works well in measuring the differences between multiple classes that are complex and hard to detect. KNN is considered a simple classification and regression algorithm.</description>
