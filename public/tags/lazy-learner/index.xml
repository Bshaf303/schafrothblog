      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;introduction-to-k-nearest-neighbor&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbor&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;KNN is a supervised learning algorithm and uses a training sample from the dataset, which classifies groups into different classes. It is a classifier used to predict the level of an unknown point (observation) and does this by measuring the points nearest to the unknown point. It works well in measuring the differences between multiple classes that are complex and hard to detect. KNN is considered a simple classification and regression algorithm. In classification, new data points are grouped into a given class, while in regression, a new data point is labeled based on the average value of k nearest neighbor. KNN is a “lazy learner” because it doesn’t learn more than the training data&lt;/p&gt;</description>
