      <description>IntroductionThis article will present a machine learning problem and the concept behind solving the problem. The project will go into detail about the early exploratory steps and build a machine learning model that can be used in production to categorize data. This project is to categorize seven Rocky Mountain tree types found in the forests. In this project, we will use old legacy data from the 1990s and use modern machine learning methods to categorize the data.</description>

      <description>Reinforcement Learning - Grid World ProblemThe first section looks at the grid world concept/problem. The environment is a 3x4 grid and the goal is to move from the start xy (1,1) (called a “state”&#34;) location to the opposite corner (4,3) called the goal state. The actions are up, down, left, right. We have the rewards of +1 &amp;amp; -1. We want the agent to find the shortest sequence of actions to get from start to end (goal).</description>

      <description>K-MeansThis project will use the Wholesale customer Data Set from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers. The data has 440 orbs and 8 variables. The data has the Channel and Region as integers but they are categorical in nature with 2 channels and 3 regions. We think this may need to be taken out of the analysis but will leave them in for now. A general observation about the variables there are outliers in the 6 major variables: fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, delicassen.</description>

      <title>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) - Heart Disease Dataset</title>

      <description>Introduction to K-Nearest NeighborKNN is a supervised learning algorithm and uses a training sample from the dataset, which classifies groups into different classes. It is a classifier used to predict the level of an unknown point (observation) and does this by measuring the points nearest to the unknown point. It works well in measuring the differences between multiple classes that are complex and hard to detect. KNN is considered a simple classification and regression algorithm.</description>

      <description>Real-Time Data and Smart Cities  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept suggesting the number of devices connected to the Internet will continue to grow. The Internet has computers and mobile devices connected to it. The expectation is IoT will become more significant with the increasing use of sensors, actuators, and embedded devices. Currently, the Internet connects devices through wired and wireless technologies. Devices also can communicate over a network and then transfer the data to the Internet.</description>
