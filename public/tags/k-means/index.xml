      <description>K-Means AnalysisThis project will use the Wholesale customer Data Set from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers. The data has 440 orbs and 8 variables. The data has the Channel and Region as integers but they are categorical in nature with 2 channels and 3 regions. We think this may need to be taken out of the analysis but will leave them in for now. A general observation about the variables there are outliers in the 6 major variables: fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, delicassen.</description>
