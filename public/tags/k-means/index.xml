      <description>K-Means Case StudyThis article is an example of practical use for k-means clustering from a case study conducted in a Chinese city. The project comes from the IoT smart city concept and looks at real-time traffic network data and uses the k-means algorithm to analyze real data. The emerging intelligent transportation techniques are helping the urban environment run smoother though very complex. The authors take a small segment and look at supply chain logistics such as for manufacturing (raw materials), utilities (coal), banking (banknotes), and the cost related to the processing and transportation between the center and the supplier points.</description>

      <description>K-Means AnalysisThis project will use the Wholesale customer Data Set from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers. The data has 440 orbs and 8 variables. The data has the Channel and Region as integers but they are categorical in nature with 2 channels and 3 regions. We think this may need to be taken out of the analysis but will leave them in for now. A general observation about the variables there are outliers in the 6 major variables: fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, delicassen.</description>
