      <description>K-Means ClusteringThe first section uses the iris data set and k-means clustering starting with 3 cluster centers and an nstart of 15. The results are displayed below in the fit object. There are 3 clusters sized 50, 62, and 38. The within sum of squares by cluster is 88.4% and the smaller number (15.15, 39.82, &amp;amp; 23.87) indicates how closely related objects are in the clusters. The first cluster has the most related objects and the second cluster has the lesser of related objects mostly taken from the third cluster.</description>

      <title>R Analysis - Plotting Graphics</title>

      <description>R Graphics for Exploring DataThe graphics device prints the graphics to screen or into a file type read by other apps. The screen device is on our computers. For windows its windows(), mac its quartz() and Linux its x11(). I am assuming this is built into the R functions plot(), xyplot(), and qplot() when we use them to plot. The other “devices” are the file types that are created by the device.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis exploratory data analysis will use the “hourly_44201_2014” data set obtained from the web site: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Raw The data is “Criteria Gases” and labeled “Ozone (44201)” for this particular data set. The data is loaded into RStudio and shows 9,060,694 rows and 24 variables.
There are 24 variables in this data set. Looking through the variables, we can see the first four are coded presumably by the EPA. The Latitude, Longitude, and Datum are geo-location data.</description>

      <title>Data Exploration - The Chicago Dataset</title>
      <link>/post/2018/07/07/data-exploration-the-chicago-dataset/</link>

      <description>IntroductionThis article is about using the tidyverse package in R to explore data. The Chicago dataset is the basis for this analysis. The data is air quality measurements taken over 19 years. The focus is on using the dplyr package to do the analysis. The dplyr package is part of the tidyverse in R and a suite of tools to analyze, transform, plot, and manipulate data. The base version of R does all of this; however, dplyr will work faster and cost fewer computing resources when used on big data.</description>
