<h3 id="welcome-to-my-portfolio">Welcome to my portfolio</h3>
<p>This website is a place where I present to the world the work I have been doing since early 2017. I possess a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Business and a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Data Science. I discovered data science in 2015 when the local news reported on the HBR article titled <em>Data Scientist: Sexiest Job of the Century</em> and talked about the tremendous growth and demand for professionals in the field where there were more open jobs than trained people to fill data roles. I had no idea what they were talking about and hit the internet reading as much as possible about the career path. My draw to data science is researching and investigating using algorithms and statistics with cutting edge computer technology. I spent 2016 doing my due diligence. There were many opinions out there on the best way to enter the field. At the time, boot camps and self-learning were what people did to get into the profession, which didn&rsquo;t feel right. Universities were starting these degree programs within their computer and information technology departments, and there was a handful around the country. I did a few courses on Udemy in Python programming, Linux, and data science fundamentals. I knew I wanted to commit to learning this path. I searched for college programs for about six months before finding one that would be a good fit. It was rigorous, and I did school coursework every day in my free time away from my job. I sacrificed a lot in those two years. The choice was well worth it, and I gained new confidence and saw my potential expand. One could learn just about anything if we apply ourselves with discipline and consistency. The profession is evolving rapidly today, and it&rsquo;s mind-boggling the amount of new tech one could learn to keep up.</p>
<p>Though my portfolio is a site for more career-related work, I enjoy the great outdoors skiing, mountain biking, and hiking. I&rsquo;m a PC gamer and also learning guitar theory and music. I enjoy automotive and home projects where I work with tools and my hands but first spend hours researching and figuring out best practices and ways to accomplish said tasks.</p>
