<main>
<p>I am a junior level data scientist professional with a Master’s Degree in Data Science. I have demonstrated abilities to extract insights from data and use them to make recommendations based on statistical modeling. I enjoy defining and solving problems by distilling abstract/complex theories and datasets into simple terms and draft meaningful easy-to-understand outcomes for both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
<p>In addition to my Data Science profession, I have a background in civil engineering. During my civil engineering career of 8+ years, I have consistently demonstrated a strong aptitude for organizing large datasets into client deliverables. I am a proven collaborative team player who has more than 5+ years managing projects in data-driven environments.</p>
